Segmentation Module
===================

Segmentation is the process from which, given a 3 dimensional dataset (volume), surfaces in the volume are found at a 
specific value. Such surfaces are also called isosurfaces.

=================================
Simpleflex Segmentation Algorithm
=================================

The CIL provides the Segmentation Algorithm described by Carr et al. [Carr2003]_ based on the calculation of the contour tree. 
The algorithm is developed in C++ and it is fully wrapped in Python. 

The algorithm expects to receive a 3D numpy array as input, and outputs a numpy array with the location of 
the points of the isosurfaces in image coordinates. 
It must be pointed out that there are at least 2 reference system of the points
of an image: 

- Image Coordinate: the actual pixel number in each dimension
- World Coordinate: the location in the *real world*
  
World coordinates are linear transformation of the image coordinate. For example, the size of the pixel (voxel) may not be uniform in the 3 dimensions resulting in a stretched image in some direction. 

The algorithm itself has no clue about the world-coordinates and its output is in image-coordinates. The user is required to apply the appropriate transformations to translate image coordinates to world coordinates. In the example that follows we will make a 
image-to-world transformation. 

------------
Installation
------------

A binary installation is available from the ccpi conda channel. It can be installed both for python 2.7 and 3.5. Install using:

::

    conda install -c ccpi -c conda-forge ccpi-segmentation numpy=1.12

-----
Usage
-----
The Python wrapper for the CIL uses numpy arrays as medium to pass data to and from each algorithm. 
3D image data should be passed to the simpleflex algorithm in form of 3D numpy arrays. 

The algorithm outputs numpy arrays. There are 2 types of output of the algorithm:


- a list of isosurfaces: in practice, for each isosurface the coordinates of points belonging to it
- for each isosurface, a mask with the voxels at the isosurface labeled.


To explain how to use it let us go through an example. In the example we will use the viewer that can be installed as follows.

::

    conda install -c ccpi -c conda-forge ccpi-viewer numpy=1.12

The data we will be using is from VTKData and has been put into a `single MetaImage file <https://github.com/vais-ral/CIL-Docs/blob/master/data/headsq/headsq.mha>`_. This link points to the original `VTKData <https://github.com/naucoin/VTKData/tree/master/Data/headsq>`_. 

First of all, we start with the proper imports:

.. code-block:: python

    from ccpi.segmentation.SimpleflexSegmentor import SimpleflexSegmentor
    import numpy
    import vtk
    from vtk.util import numpy_support
    from ccpi.viewer.CILViewer import CILViewer
    

The Create a Segmentor and pass data
....................................

The algorithm accepts input as 3D numpy arrays. It will detect the dimensions and it will scale the image to an appropriate size (unsigned short or unsigned char). 

The algorithm is wrapped in a Object oriented fashion, and therefore it needs to be instatiated and passed the data. 

.. code-block:: python


    # 1. create a segmentor object
    segmentor = SimpleflexSegmentor()

    # 2. Load some data and pass data into the algorithm
    # load data with vtk
    filename = "C:\\Path\\to\\VTKData\\Data\\headsq\\headsq.mha"

    # read the data as 3D numpy array
    data3d , reader = readAs3DNumpyArray(filename)

    # accepts input as 3D numpy array
    segmentor.setInputData(data3d)

	
The function readAs3DNumpyArray uses vtk to read a MetaImage file and convert it to a numpy array.

.. code-block:: python


    def readAs3DNumpyArray(filename):
    	reader = vtk.vtkMetaImageReader()
    	reader.SetFileName(filename)
    	reader.Update()
    	# transform the VTK data to 3D numpy array
    	nparray = Converter.vtk2numpy(reader.GetOutput())
    	return (nparray , reader)
		

Running the segmentation
........................

The only thing to specify to the algorithm is the target isovalue:

.. code-block:: python


    # 3. Calculate the Contour Tree
    segmentor.calculateContourTree()

    # 4. Set the iso-value in percent of the image dynamic range
    # one can also pass the actual value 
    #segmentor.setIsoValue(some_value)
    segmentor.setIsoValuePercent(35)

    # 5. Construct the iso-surfaces
    segmentor.constructIsoSurfaces()


Retrieve the data
.................

To retrieve the calculated isosurfaces one has to invoke the getSurfaces method which returns the list of isosurfaces a numpy array. To explain
how the data are organized in the array, let's first consider that a surface is made of triangles in space, which in turn
are identified by 3 points in space, which are identified by 3 spatial coordinates: 

- point = array([coordX, coordY, coordZ, 1])
- surface = array([point_0, point_1, point_2,... ]
- listOfIsosurfaces = array([surface_0, surface_1, surface_2,...])

This list is sorted from largest to smallest surface. For instance, the second largest surface will be the second element of the array.

To retrieve the mask from the same isosurface one can use the following code. Notice that during the retrieval we can access the volume of the voxels at the isosurface,
the volume of the voxels with value above/below the isovalue. If the spacing is (1,1,1), the volume is the number of voxels. 

.. code-block:: python


    mask = segmentor.getSurfaceAsMask(0, labelIso=1, labelHigh=2, labelLow=0)
    print ("Volume of iso %d" % segmentor.isoVolume)
    print ("Volume of lower %d" % segmentor.lowVolume)
    print ("Volume of higher %d" % segmentor.highVolume)
	# reshape the mask as the original data
    mask = numpy.reshape(mask, numpy.shape(data3d))
  
That is basically it! You can run the following script that will do the segmentation and show something on screen.
